By ignoring the stigma of prestige, we look at the attributes of schools and universities from the perspective of those who have experienced them. Asking the questions specific to an education in the arts, we can go deeper into the ideologies and processes that make creative education's unique.</h4>

Students leaving primary education in search of an education in creative fields are confronted with placement rates and proximity to cities. While not to be neglected, those figures are not representative of an education in the arts. Representation of creative programs revolve around feelings, ideology and process, not food quality or athletics.</h4>

            <p id="story_text">As a graduating design student I was confronted with the monumental undertaking of self authoring a senior project. Scary at first, I found comfort in resorting to treating design as a way to answer a question, or bring clarity to something confusing and convoluted. After ideas were tested and have since died, I resorted to thinking about my college experience here at Purchase and how exactly it had let me here. That discourse began to ask questions, of how and why. In the interest of those questions I landed on, how exactly did I decide to go to purchase and why? The answer, while illusive at first, became very simple. My decision was made on mostly irrelevant and sometimes false information and ultimately rendered my selection almost completely arbitrary. My education in design has expanded my understanding of how and why the world works and what I can do about it. How could something that has shaped the world in front of me and completely transformed my logic be an arbitrary decision? The answer is that I was poorly informed and got lucky. I could not have made an informed decision until I graduated with a BFA in graphic design. In the spirit of using design to make to make the world a better place, I began work on creating a tool that can both educate prospective designers on the spectrums within design as well as present them with a level of transparency into the institutions they are about to commit massive amounts of capital. I wanted to create a space where designers can look out for other designers, where institutions will be held accountable and where you can get information you can trust. EOTD is not for the institution to convince you, it's for you to have a fair chance at making an informed decision.
